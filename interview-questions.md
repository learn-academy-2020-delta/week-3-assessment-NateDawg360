# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is one of my favorite methods.  It allows us to destructor datatypes, such as an array, or string, and we can return elements  specifically needed to either run an action, or to display specific items that we'd like to render up to our browser.

  Researched answer: better stated, it extracts properties, and binds them to variables.



2. What are React lifecycle methods? Provide three examples.

  Your answer: In simple terms, you could say its proccess from beginning to end to establish the job of the component, and has 3 different phases.  Mounting is where you add elements into the dom, which is the server where we want the component to render to.  Updating is the next phase where we can change the arguments or functions and it will update the lifecycle of that component so it can continue running whatever changes were made.  Unmounting is removing the component all together, ending its task.

  Researched answer:  getDerivedStateFromProps() is a method in the update state that updates any changes made in the dom.



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object carries hold values within it which can be destructored.  Objects are members of a Class, aka "instances".  Classes hold different objects and Objects hold values.

  Researched answer: This reminds me of Components in React, but in a smaller version.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: a div is a line of code that's used mainly to display CSS based layouts, while a span is used to stylize the text.

  Researched answer: I honestly had no idea a div was specifically used for displaying css elements, that's really cool!  It also has the resonsibility of transfering clumps of data into the html file to display.



5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: A React.Fragment groups child components and assigns them their tasks.  I would use this instead of a div so i wouldn't have to pack more modules and save keystrokes.

  Researched answer:  It is also used to input conditional rendering without having you make more lines of if statements (very cool)



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: 3 common responsive designs options are media queries, fluid grids, and flexible images.

  Researched answer: Media queries are layouts that display different types of media such as videos, pictures etc.  Fluid grid can display different art layouts without having to worry about affecting any css elements getting distorted on the page.  Flexible images allows images on the page to resize with the window size displaying the image.



7. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props renders functions from the parent component in react to the child component.

  Researched answer: Props are "read-only" which means we should never directly change it in the dom.



8. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 'this' is so we can identify to the program what element belongs to what object.

  Researched answer: the call() and apply() methods allow us to refer back to 'this'



9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

  Your answer: It is used to complete 3 different functions.  First you establish a condition (example: an if statement) then it can identify is that condition is true. Then if it finds that the condition is false, it stops running.

  Researched answer:  This uses the ? method, which is the first time I've seen this used, which is used to establish the condition.



10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: an anonymous function is a function that may have served a purpose at one point but doesn't, or cannot, be used again.

  Researched answer: It is a function that's not stored, but it is associated with a variable.
